# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support security fixes for the most recent release(s) of Multiflex Core.
If you are unsure whether your version is supported, please open an issue (for non-sensitive topics) or use the vulnerability reporting process below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Preferred reporting method:
- Use GitHub **Security Advisories**: go to the repository's **Security** tab and click **Report a vulnerability**.

We currently do not accept vulnerability reports via email.
If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories for some reason, please reach out via the general contact address below and we will coordinate a secure channel.

When reporting, please include:
- Affected version/commit
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Impact assessment (what an attacker can do)
- Any proof-of-concept code (if safe) or logs

We aim to acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and will coordinate a responsible disclosure process with you.

## General contact (non-security)
